I am a post-graduate student at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, specializing in Data Science for Business Analytics. Currently, I am serving as a Machine Learning Research Intern at [AppSteer](https://www.appsteer.ai/){:target="\_blank} in Texas since May 2023, where, I led the development of prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs), elevating their capabilities through Langchain and Huggingface technologies. Notably, I achieved rapid deployment by crafting and implementing a fully functional API within a six-week timeframe, significantly enhancing operational efficiency. Leveraging AWS and Azure, I implemented scalable solutions, reducing app development timelines to minutes.

Previously, I contributed to a research project at [Stellenbosch University](http://www.sun.ac.za/english){:target="\_blank"} focused on diagnosing COVID-19 using deep learning algorithms applied to cough audio.

In my professional experience, I served as a Senior Data Science Consultant at [EY (Ernst & Young)](https://www.ey.com/en_in){:target="\_blank"}, utilizing statistical methods and machine learning models on time-series data to forecast Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) demand in the Nordic region. Concurrently, at [Applied Roots](https://www.appliedroots.com/){:target="\_blank"}, I mentored students in Deep Learning and model optimization, conducting meticulous assessments of over 600 assignments daily, ensuring adherence to industry standards.

My career journey began as a software developer at [Redallcco Infotech](https://www.redaallco.com/){:target="\_blank"}, where I discovered the vast potential of synergizing human and computer efforts to develop data-driven techniques for business growth and research advancement. Motivated by this, I delved deeper into data science, dedicating my free time to online courses, certifications, and data challenges.

In 2019, I transitioned to a full-time focus on data science, engaging in research projects related to machine learning in medicine, serving as an ML Engineer at Applied Roots, and freelancing as a Data Scientist. I specialize in assisting businesses in solving modern problems through data-driven approaches.
