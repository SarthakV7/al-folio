I am a post-graduate student at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, specializing in Data Science for Business Analytics. Previously, I worked on a research project with [Stellenbosch University](http://www.sun.ac.za/english){:target="\_blank"} for diagnosing COVID-19 using deep learning algorithms on cough audio.

My experience includes working as a Senior Data Science Consultant at [EY (Ernst & Young)](https://www.ey.com/en_in){:target="\_blank"}, where I used statistical methods and machine learning models on time-series data to forecast FMCG demand in the Nordic region. I also mentored students on Deep Learning and model optimization while working at [Applied Roots](https://www.appliedroots.com/){:target="\_blank"}, evaluating over 600 assignments daily and keeping them updated with industry standards.

My career began as a software developer at [Redallcco infotech](https://www.redaallco.com/){:target="\_blank"}, where I discovered the immense potential of combining human and computer efforts to develop data-driven techniques for business growth and research advancement. This motivated me to dive deeper into data science, investing my free time in online courses, certifications, and data challenges.

In 2019, I decided to pursue data science full-time, working on research projects related to machine learning in medicine, ML Engineer at Applied Roots, and freelancing as a Data Scientist. I help businesses solve modern problems using data-driven approaches.
